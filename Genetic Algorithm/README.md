## Travelling Salesman problem (TSP):
    The travelling salesman problem (TSP) asks the following question:  "Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, what is the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city?". 
    
- For simplicity, we aren't coming back to origin city for now.
## Genetic Algorithm:
    genetic algorithm (GA) is a metaheuristic inspired by the process of natural selection that belongs to the larger class of evolutionary algorithms (EA). Genetic algorithms are commonly used to generate high-quality solutions to optimization and search problems by relying on biologically inspired operators such as mutation, crossover and selection.


### Updates
- Added a simple implementation in Julia
